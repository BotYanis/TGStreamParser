# Telegram Stream Parser

Telegram Stream Parser is a Python-based application that uses the aiogram and pyrogram libraries to parse and analyze data from Telegram conversations and groups. It provides a powerful tool for extracting relevant information from Telegram streams, allowing you to gain valuable insights and identify patterns and trends.

## Features

- Extract user profiles, message text, media files, and more from Telegram conversations and groups
- Define custom parsing rules and filters to adapt the parser to different use cases
- Monitor for specific keywords, track user activity, or identify spam or malicious content
- Built on top of the aiogram and pyrogram libraries, providing an easy-to-use API and low-level control over the Telegram API

## Requirements

- Python 3.7 or higher
- aiogram 2.13.2 or higher
- pyrogram 1.3.1 or higher

## Installation

To install Telegram Stream Parser, clone this repository and install the required dependencies using pip:

```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/telegram-stream-parser.git
cd telegram-stream-parser
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To use Telegram Stream Parser, you will need to create a Telegram bot and obtain an API token. You can create a bot and obtain a token by following the instructions in the [Telegram Bot API documentation](https://core.telegram.org/bots#3-how-do-i-create-a-bot).

Once you have obtained a token, create a new file called `config.py` in the project directory and add the following lines:

```python
API_ID = YOUR_API_ID
API_HASH = 'YOUR_API_HASH'
BOT_TOKEN = 'YOUR_BOT_TOKEN'
```

Replace `YOUR_API_ID`, `YOUR_API_HASH`, and `YOUR_BOT_TOKEN` with your own values.

You can then run the parser using the following command:

```
python main.py
```

This will start the parser and begin processing messages from your Telegram conversations and groups. You can customize the parsing rules and filters by editing the `parser.py` file.
